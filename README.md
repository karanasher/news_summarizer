# news_summarizer
A Flask application that uses NewsAPI to fetch the latest news articles from different sources and summarizes the same into a 100 word version for easier consumption

## Motivation
Consuming news is often a challenge given the nature of webpages. There are always some pop-ups, random videos playing in the background and many other design elements that distracts a user from consuming what's most important aka the actual news article. This is the motivation behind building news_summarizer. 

## What does this do?
This is a Flask application that uses NewsAPI to fetch the latest top headlines and summarizes the news articles using HuggingFace transformer model for easier consumption.
